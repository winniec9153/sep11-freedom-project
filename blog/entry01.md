#### Content: 
The tool I decided to use is [p5play](https://p5play.org/), a JavaScript game engine built on p5.js that allows users to create interactive games and animations. I’ve been learning through the [P5Play learning section](https://p5play.org/learn/) and watching a [YouTube video introducing P5Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQmFqhZ11K8&t=330s), which has been very beginner-friendly. So far, I’ve explored the basic properties of sprites, such as adjusting their position, size, color, and rotation, as well as how to create and manage groups using [(Soft and Dynamic Inheritance)](https://p5play.org/learn/group?page=0). These groups let multiple sprites share traits and move together, which I found really interesting. I’ve been recording my progress in my learning log and experimenting with combining what I’ve learned to prepare for creating my own interactive project, which is a budgeting game.

### Engineering Design Process: 
Currently, I am in the first stage of the Engineering Design Process, where I am identifying specific issues in the world today. Something I noticed was that many people struggle with budgeting as they often spend way too much money on unnecessary things and leaving little room for essentials. My goal is to design a fun and interactive game that helps people of all ages learn how to budget in an engaging and enjoyable, which can be used in their daily life. 

### Skills:
Some skills I gained along the way include basic coding in JavaScript, as I learned how to write and edit code to create interactive elements using JS. I also developed an understanding of sprites as I learned how to control their position, size, color, rotation, and shape. In addition, I gained experience working with groups of sprites, which allowed me to apply shared properties and move multiple objects at once which is really cool. Through this process, I also improved my problem-solving skills, as I learned how to identify and fix coding errors while experimenting with new features, enhance my thinking skills too.
